# Vue 3 Composition API examples

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

## Project explanation

Vue 3's function-based API was proposed in an RFC in May 2019, and it was divisive. I wanted to better understand the benefits and so I created this repository for the purposes of better appreciating some of the changes that will be coming down the line.

The project was used in conjunction with a presentation that I made for VueJS Glasgow's meetup.

## The project

The project is divided into a series of little apps that demonstrate how to achieve some of the basic Vue 2.x outcomes with Vue 3.0's API.

The Todo list was forked from a handy Codepen made by [@sharon-the-encoder](https://codepen.io/sharon-the-encoder) (@CodeFa on Github) - which sped up my intial work!
